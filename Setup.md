To set up an AWS EventBridge rule to trigger an ECS Fargate task when a file is uploaded to an S3 bucket in another account, here’s a step-by-step guide with considerations for integrating with your company’s infrastructure using Terraform, Jules, and Spinnaker.

**1. Set Up S3 Bucket Permissions** 

Since the S3 bucket is in a different AWS account, you need to grant permissions for your account to receive events when a file is uploaded. In the bucket owner's account:

Go to the S3 bucket in the other account.
Add an S3 Event Notification for object creation. Configure this to send the event to an EventBridge rule (specify your AWS account ID).
Update the bucket policy to allow s3:PutObject permission to the EventBridge in your account.

Example bucket policy for S3 event notification permissions:
```tf
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "Your-Account-ID"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


**2. Configure EventBridge Rule in Your Account**

Use Terraform to define an EventBridge rule that listens for S3 event notifications:

```tf
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "trigger_fargate" {
  name        = "TriggerFargateOnS3Upload"
  description = "Triggers an ECS Fargate task on file upload to S3"
  event_pattern = jsonencode({
    "source": ["aws.s3"],
    "detail-type": ["Object Created"],
    "resources": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"]
  })
}
```
