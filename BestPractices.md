# Best practices for efficient integration and performance optimization

**1. Efficient task definitions** 
Since task definition includes CPU and memory requirements, Determining the right specifications for these resources to prevent over-provisioning. This will not only reduce cost, but also speed up start-up time, as tasks are containerized in Fargate.

**2. Auto scaling limits**
Set memory utilization or CPU utilization as a target for auto scaling in ECS Fargate service, 

**3. Monitoring Metrics** Use CloudWatch to monitor CPU, memory, and network usage. Set alarms on CPU Utilizaiton and memory utilization. Leverage these metrics to help decide on auto scaling limits.

**4. AWS Fargate Spot** This pricing plan utilizes spare capacity in AWS to run the task. But the task will be interrupted when AWS needs to reclaim capacity. This pricing plan could be useful for parallelizable workloads.
